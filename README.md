# historyApp
The Android application discussed in this report is a History generating tool designed to educate users on hero of the nation who have died in the past. This app is intended for students or any other person who wishes to find information on heroes and heroin who dedicated their live to change society in some way. The app aims to minimize the lack of knowledge about who had a recognizable impact on the society we find ourselves in.
The main objective of this project was to develop a functional, user-friendly app that provides briefs on historical figures. The app includes information from trusted sources like Journals, History books and education articles which provide accurate information.
The app’s design was based on subtle colors and a background theme which immediately makes you aware that you are about to dive deep into an educational space. A secondary goal was to build the app in a way that allowed scalability for current and future heroes to be included in the database as time goes, and a easy to use programming language like Kotlin for maintenance and ensuring the is robust and flexible.
